## Installation
To install the driver, simply clone this repository onto your local machine. The driver source code is located in the src directory.

## Dependencies
The driver requires the following dependencies to be installed:

STM32CubeMX or 
Keil MDK-ARM

## Configuration
To configure the driver for your specific use case, you will need to modify the spi_driver_config.h file. This file contains configuration settings for the SPI driver, including the SPI clock frequency, the SPI data format, and the SPI slave select pin.

## Building
To build the driver, open the STM32_SPI_DeviceDriver.uvprojx project file in Keil MDK-ARM and build the project.

## Usage
To use the driver in your own project, simply include the spi_driver.h header file and call the appropriate functions to initialize and communicate with the SPI peripheral. Example code is provided in the main.c file to demonstrate how to use the driver.
